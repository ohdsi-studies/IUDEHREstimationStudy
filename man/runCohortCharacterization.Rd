DatabaseConnector package.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where intermediate data can be stored. You will need to have
write priviliges in this schema. Note that for SQL Server, this should
include both the database and schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{cohortTable}{The name of the table that will be created in the work database schema.
This table will hold the exposure and outcome cohorts used in this
